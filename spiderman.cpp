/** @brief DP on range of distances and target sum
 * 
 * Our goal is to minimize the height needed to travel 
 * a given range of distances (a1, a2, a3, ..., an) such that 
 * the target sum of these distances equals 0.
 * 
 * We use dynamic programming on both the range of distances 
 * AND the target sum such that P[N, K] represents the minimal
 * achievable height when attempting to travel the first N distances 
 * and arrive to a final height of K.
 *  
 * S[N, K] will hold the move executed by element N, when travelling
 * to the final height of K. This move is either UP (add N) or DOWN 
 * subtract (N).
 * 
 * The vector D is used to hold the distances provided as input
 *
